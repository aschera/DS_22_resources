# Exercise 3
# Create 2 lists with slightly different elements in them.

# Test what happens if you run arrhythmic operations on these. Try adding the lists together with + and see what happens.
# Try multiplying the lists by * and see what happens.

# Try that next lists and see how far down you can get :D. Forgot to mention that to access elements in a nested
# list, you just add more ticks. For example, if you have a list called l = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] then
# you can access 5 by typing l[1][1]. It is the first ticks that indicate which list you want to access and the second tick that indicates which
# element in that list you want to access. So it's a list of lists. This can be done several times.
