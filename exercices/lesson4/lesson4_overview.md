# Exercises
The step-by-step exercise here will be to create a syllabus/organizer, mostly to get a better grasp of classes, what they are and how they are used.

The challenge will be a found in the lake game.

Syllabus part 1
We start by creating a class to keep track of a course. We will use this class to keep track of the course name, the course code, the number of credits the course is worth, and how many credits the course has.

We will create a class called Course and it will have the following attributes:

name - Name of the course
code - The code of the course
credits - The number of credits the course is worth
Then create one in the class that can print this info about this course in a nice and formatted way.

For example, Course: Python Course code: DS_22_python Points: 40

Create a main function, create an instance of the class using the constructor and print it using your method.

Syllabus part 2
A course also has a teacher who teaches this course. We want to be able to keep track of the teacher's name and email address. We also want to be able to print the teacher's name and email address.

Create a class called Teacher. You can make up what you want to be on this. But here too create a method to print it a little nicer.

add a teacher to the Course class and print it using your method.

Syllabus part 3
What is a course without students? We want to be able to keep track of which students are taking this course. We also want to be able to print which students are taking this course.

Create a class for students. I think you are starting to get the hang of this now.

Since a class rarely only has one student, a different data structure than a simple instance in the Course class will be needed. You probably know which one.

Syllabus part 4
Do the same as above but do for Lessons during the course.

Then create methods on the Course class to add and remove students and lessons.

Syllabus part 5
Create a menu in main where the user can select some options.

Add a teacher to a course
Add a student to a course
Add a lesson to a course
Print a course
End
Remember that every time the program is closed, everything will disappear as we have not learned to save data yet. But that comes next.
